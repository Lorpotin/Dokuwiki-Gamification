====== Copypaste Game Code Camp 2014 ======

CPCC2014 is a game development code camp with a twist: Instead of starting from scratch you take existing games and improve them! The theme for modding the games is: Game crossovers, shared achievements and linked games.

====== After Action Report ======

After the codecamp each group is required to write a 5 page report on the same theme as your wiki pages. The goal is to write more detailed description of the project, making process and the end results. Examples of questions
  * What did we start to do? 
  * What did we really do? 
  * What problems did we have? 
  * What did work and what not? 
  * What should have been done in another way? 

**Send the reports to Janne Parkkila (first.last@lut.fi) by Sunday 05.10.2014 - 23.59.**
  * Only add the links to the document. Upload the actual document to wiki page (all you information should be on the wiki pages)

====== Practical Arrangements ======

Codecamp will be held in the Usability Lab 26.-28.9


**What are recommended skills for code camp ?**

Basic programming skills and will to learn new things.
A little bit wacky attitude.
Knowing the basics of Unity3D is a big plus :-)

**Can I prepare to Code Camp ?**

Yes, and you should! During the code camp we will concentrate on implementing our ideas and connecting the games together. The design phase this time should happen BEFORE the actual codecamp weekend.

**How about sleeping?**

Sleeping on the University premises is not allowed. You can work 24/7 but we highly suggest you spend the night in your own comfortable bed :-)
